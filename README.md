# Electronics Projects
This repository contains electronics projects developed for studying and practical application of concepts in digital circuits and power systems. Currently, it includes two main projects:

## Projects
### 1. Gray Counter
- **Description**: Implementation of a Gray counter, a sequential circuit that generates a Gray code sequence.
- **Software used**: [Multisim](https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/software-products/download.multisim.html)
- **Objective**: Study of digital counters, sequential circuits, and Gray code to minimize bit transitions.
- **Files**: Circuit schematic, Multisim simulation, and state diagram.

### 2. Switched Mode Power Supply
- **Description**: Design of a switched-mode power supply, optimizing energy efficiency in electronic systems.
- **Software used**: [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/)
- **Objective**: Development of a compact power supply with a 15V output.
- **Files**: Schematic, PCB layout.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
